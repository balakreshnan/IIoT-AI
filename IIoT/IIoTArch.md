# Industrial IoT â€“ ML End to End Architecture

## OEE, Quality, Reliability, Process Optimization, Root Cause, Automation

## Use Case

Building a industrial IoT Application for Heavy machinery, oil and gas and also for manufacturing operations. A system capable of getting large volume data and to provide analytics and process optimization.
Also Ability to design dashboards for OEE, Root cause analysis. Apply machine learning to the data and provide insights. 
To build a complete solution for the above.

## Architecture

## Architecturial Consideration

- Ability to ingest large volume of data from lots of equipment.
- Micro or Mini batch in ingest
- Minimize ETL process and provide faster insights
- Apply machine learning inference as data in motion and store results.
- Ability to provide Root cause analysis (not historical)
- Ability to stream real time insights to Power BI
- Ability to Store and retrieve time series data without organizing or using ETL for performance.
- Ability to build dashboard or web application for consumers like mobile, Virtual Assistance, Web Site.
