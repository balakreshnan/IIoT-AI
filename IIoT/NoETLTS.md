# No ETL based Time Series Storage and Processing for Industrial Application

## Use Case

Working with large volume time series (sensor data) is been very challenging. Just to do cleanup and quality of Time series data and scaling and processing for aggregration is very time consuming process. Now to join the time series with business data like alarms and events and do root cause analysis or trending to find what happened is a challenge.

What is there is a cloud based Platform as a Service that we could use for no ETL based Time series storage and anlaytical processing. Traditionaly there has been historian data base which does a great job but limitation are scaling and cost. Historians can scale but very expensive.
